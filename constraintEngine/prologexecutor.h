 * The PrologExecutor class connects with the SWI-Prolog clpfd library(http://www.swi-prolog.org/man/clpfd.html) that is use as
 * constraint solver. This class implements the RoutingEngine interface from FluidicMachineModel library is in charge of resolving
 * a constraints problems: once a set of flows are sets on a machine an state for each: valve, pump, container and tube is calculated
 * so all the flows are mantain.
 *
 * In order to do so, creates a temporary file with a prolog predicate that contains variables representing each: valve, pump, tube and
 * container of a machine and loads this file in the SWI-prolog interprete. Each time a new set flows need to be processed, the predicate
 * of the temporary file is invoqued with the value of the variables that the flows sets, thepredicate returns the value of the rests of
 * components of the system so the flows are mantained using the minimal number of pumps and valves.
